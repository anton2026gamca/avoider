# Avoider

A game where you are a space ship, you fly through the space, dodge meteoroids and shoot them. You can also control what you will invest your power into (e.g. acceleration, shields, etc.)

I built this project for [midnight](https://midnight.hackclub.com/), an event by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/).

This project is built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
